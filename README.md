Stupefy is an early-stage engine currently developed for Windows only!

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 is recommended, Stupefy is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/Stupefy-Engine/Stupefy`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

After cloneing the repository run `GenerateProject.bat` to get all the Visual Studio 2019 files.
