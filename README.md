#### 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

Stupefy Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and
3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of common
tools, so that users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the
wheel. Games can be exported in one click to a number of platforms, including
the major desktop platforms (Linux, Mac OSX, Windows) as well as mobile
(Android, iOS) and web-based (HTML5) platforms.
